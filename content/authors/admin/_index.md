I am an international student in MSc at Boston College where I study economics. My passion has always been decoding of human rationale and decision-making. Here you can find my academic and passion projects! 

I mainly focus on development and behavioral economics - most of my research is on migration and determinants of migration in the modern world. My hypothesis is that determinants of migration can be identified through the use of computational complexity theory and prospect theory.
